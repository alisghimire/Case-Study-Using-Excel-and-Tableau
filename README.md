# Case Study - Using Excel and Tableau

This exploratory analysis is part of my portfolio involving real-world scenario. I dive into a revenue report of a B2B company and demonstrate my data analysis skills in a simulated business context, offering insights and findings derived from examining the dataset. 

This analysis will feature 6 steps of data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Visualize, and Act.



## ASK

Description: Our analysis focuses on the revenue report of a B2B company that provides tech services in different regions across the US.

To gain insights into the company's revenue report, we will answer the following questions:

1. Which departments contribute the most to the overall revenue?
2. What percentage of the total revenue is generated by each region?
3. What clients bring in the highest revenue?

By addressing these questions, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the company's revenue generation and offer recommendations to enhance their marketing strategies.



## PREPARE

The revenue data is recorded in a .**xsl** file and is unformatted. It contains errors and inconsistencies like uneven spaces, duplicate values, error messages, etc. 

Thus data cleaning is required to ensure accuracy and consistency. 

Here’s what the dataset looks like initially:

## PROCESS

Here's a step-by-step description of how I cleaned up the dataset using Excel:

1. **Find and Replace**: Deleted parentheses containing useless information.

2. **Lower and Upper Function**: Created a new column, converted client names to lowercase using the `LOWER(text)` formula, and removed the original column.

3. **Trim and Proper**: Ensured consistent name formatting by removing uneven spaces and capitalizing words appropriately.

4. **Text to Columns**: Separated the region from the department using the "Text to Columns" function.

5. **Removed Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate entries from the dataset.

6. **IFERROR Function**: Handled errors in the profit margin by displaying "NA" for missing revenue data.

Here’s how the dataset looks like after implementing these steps:

## ANALYZE

I then used Tableau to transform and analyze the cleaned dataset. By using features such as `change data types`, ****`filters`, `table calculation`, I was able to identify patterns and relationships among different variables, I was able to identify patterns, trends, and relationships among different variables. 

The charts I created in Tableau provided a clear visual representation of the data, making it easier to interpret and communicate key findings effectively.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the analysis of the provided dashboard, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. **Total Revenue by Department**

- The strategy department emerges as the top-performing department, generating a total revenue of $41.5k.
- It is closely followed by the cloud tech department with $32.5k and the big tech department with $32.3k.
- The operations department recorded the lowest revenue at $23.1k.

Given the strong performance of the strategy department, it would be advisable to invest further resources and support in this department to maximize revenue. Additionally, the cloud tech and big tech departments show potential and should receive continued attention to sustain their revenue growth.

2. **Revenue Percent by Regions**

- New York (NY) contributes the highest percentage of revenue, accounting for 32.12%.
- This is followed by Texas with 25.11%,
- California (Cali) with 24.94%
- Florida with 17.84%.

With New York, Texas, and California contributing the majority of revenue, it would be beneficial to prioritize these regions for further expansion and marketing efforts. However, it is also important to explore opportunities in other regions to diversify the customer base and tap into new revenue streams.

3. **Top 10 Revenue-Generating Clients**

- Dell, with a revenue contribution of $7.5k, ranks as the top highest revenue-generating client.
- Chevron follows closely with a revenue contribution of $7.3k, securing a second position.
- Comcast demonstrates a significant revenue contribution of $6.5k, solidifying third position.

Building and maintaining strong relationships with high-revenue clients such as Dell, Chevron, and Comcast should be a priority. This includes providing excellent customer service, personalized offerings, and proactive account management to ensure continued revenue generation and foster long-term partnerships.
